;; About
;;
;; The goal for persistent-overlays is to maintain persistent overlays
;; between emacs sessions. It has been tested with hideshow and
;; outline modes on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows. However, this version
;; should be considered beta software and it has not been previously
;; released.
;; 
;; Overlays are stored in ~/.emacs-pov by default. There are several
;; customizable variables which allow a user to change the file naming
;; convention and the storage location of the overlay files.
;;
;; Please use describe-mode for a full description.
;;
;; To enable this mode add the following to your ~/.emacs or
;; ~/emacs.d/init.el file. This assumes that you have placed
;; persistent-overlays.el somewhere in your load-path.
;;
;; (load-library "persistent-overlays")

;; Enjoy

;; ===== Define the mode ======================================================

(define-minor-mode pov-minor-mode
  "This is a minor mode to make overlays persistent by saving
them to a file and subsequently loading them. By default overlays
are stored in ~/.emacs-pov with a file name that is created as a
SHA1 hash of the buffer name to which they correspond.
`pov-directory' may be set to indicate a different directory in
which to store overlays. If `pov-use-path-name' is set to t, the
overlay file is named after the full path of the file instead of
using a SHA1 hash.

`pov-property-name' specifics a property symbol that must exist
in an overlay for it to be handled by this mode. By default it is
set to the symbol 'hs so that hideshow overlays are handled.

If `pov-auto-save' is t and `pov-minor-mode' is active, all
overlays containing `pov-property-name' will be saved in the
directory indicated by `pov-directory' when the buffer is saved.

If `pov-auto-load' is t and `pov-minor-mode' is active, existing
overlays for the buffer will be loaded from `pov-directory' when
the buffer is loaded or when `pov-minor-mode' is enabled.

NOTE: There is currently no mechanism for synchronizing overlay
files with the corresponding user files when files are moved. If
you wish to retain existing stored overlays you should manually
load or merge the overlays from the original overlay file in
`pov-directory' after renaming the user file. You may also want
to delete the original overlay file after merging to avoid having
unused overlay files lying around. Each overlay file contains the
full path name of the file to which it applies as its first line.
